# 🧠 LLM Project 1 – DataCamp LLM Project

A DataCamp exercise focusing on practical Large Language Model (LLM) workflows, including prompt design, model inference, and evaluation using Python and the OpenAI API.

---

## 📘 Overview

This notebook guides users through:

1. Loading and exploring an example text dataset
2. Crafting prompts for the OpenAI GPT-family models
3. Performing inference and generating responses
4. Evaluating output quality (e.g., correctness, fluency)
5. Optional extensions with Gradio API deployment

Ideal for: Anyone learning hands-on LLM usage in Python.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Prompt Design**: Experiment with zero-shot and few-shot setups
- **Model Inference**: Queries GPT‑3.5 / GPT‑4 via OpenAI Python SDK
- **Evaluation**: Basic accuracy or scoring metrics for outputs
- **Visualization/Output**: Displays model replies inline
- **Deployment-ready**: Integration stub for Gradio-based UI

---

## 🧰 Technologies

- Python 3.10+  
- `openai` Python SDK  
- (Optionally) Gradio or Streamlit for UI  
- Jupyter notebook environment — compatible with local, Colab, or Binder

## ⚡ Quickstart

1. **Clone this repo**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Khairul-islam99/LLM_Project-1-.git
    cd LLM_Project-1-
    ```

2. **Install requirements**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **(Optional)** Add your OpenAI API key:

    ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
    ```

4. **Run the notebook** in Jupyter or Colab:

    ```bash
